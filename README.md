# Front end protfolio (2) version control 2025
I recently lost the source code to my original react site [arjunliji.free.nf](https://arjunliji.free.nf)
FYI that site I made was using ai like a crutch and I didnt bother to solve bugs and I ended up with a huge labarynth of a code noodles which got confusing progresively as it became bigger.
In 2025, now that I'm an under graduate in computer science engeering I decided to rebuild that portfolio again from scratch!
Except this time, its gonna be 
- more visually appealing
- better ux and ui
- better design
- dynamic site with database
- custom domain instead of free.nf
- non-ai look and more personality and creativity
